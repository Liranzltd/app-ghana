I am self-employed doing this for various businesses for a number of years now, I feed my family doing it so I won't complain.  I have a way of getting immediate interested traffic and buyers to your site through social media channels and email.  As well as getting more likes, followers for all of your social accounts.  I have a new program that has just been completed that listens to all tweets being made, if a certain word or phrase is detected, we instantly send back to them a tweet that they should visit our site.  We can use as many search terms as we want, 100's of targeted visits a day.  I can even help you make a site, fix site errors add updates etc. if you might need it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, I'd also like to find out what your competitors have done that we havn't done yet and address those issues asap.  I'd also like to make a video or 2 about your site and get them to rank high pretty quickly.  Lastly I have a large database of opt in customers that are interested in what it is you do, so if you'd like to expand your current newsletter list let me know, I can get you these records whenever you'd like them.  They would get you instant leads by supplying you with a list of people or businesses that are looking for exactly what it is you're offering.\r\n\r\nI use tools that a lot of people dont know about or don't have time to use for themselves and would like to use them for your site.  If your to busy with current clients I get it, I was just wondering was all.  Let me know if youd like more information or references, I have more than I know what to do with.\r\n\r\nWinston\r\n1.319.423.9473",
